Designed and simulated a 4:1 multiplexer at the transistor level using Microwind, implementing both CMOS and transmission gate logic
styles. Analyzed and compared power, area, and delay metrics, demonstrating improved efficiency with transmission gate implementation. Verified functionality through waveform simulations and optimized layout for minimal complexity, gaining strong insights
into transistor-level design andÂ optimization.
